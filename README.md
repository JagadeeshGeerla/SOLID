# SOLID

### SRP	The Single Responsibility Principle:
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

### OCP	The Open Closed Principle:
You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it. Open to extensions, closed for modifications.

### LSP	The Liskov Substitution Principle:
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. You should be able to use any derived class instead 
of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification

### ISP	The Interface Segregation Principle:
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. (Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.)

### DIP	The Dependency Inversion Principle:
A: High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
B: Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
